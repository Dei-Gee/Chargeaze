# Chargeaze
A web application built by team GKF, for the 2017 New Westminster Hackathon. 
As part of the Hackathon, we were required to access the city's open sets of data and use them in a practical way.
Our team had the idea of using the electric vehicle charging station and open art data sets to:
1. Find the nearest EV charging station.
2. Look for something to do while waiting for the vehicle to charge.

We built Chargeaze using HTML, CSS, Javascript and the Google Maps Web API. 

## Team GKF
Our team is comprised of four college students: Andrew Smith, Lucas Guariglia, Osbjorn Gulbranson and Heitor Frossard.
